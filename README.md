## "Git in Practice" Reflection
It has been a little bit since I've last used Git and its commands. I think I've become a lot more careless since then; I accidentally clicked "revert" at one point, creating a new pull request to revert my previous changes. Luckily, I ended up just deleting the newly created revert branch, but I panicked for a little bit anyway. In the past, I worked through version control systems (just Subversion and Git) by myself, and I didn't watch any tutorials; I just learned through trial and error. That's why it was quite helpful to see a tutorial from a reputable source (professor) because I am not as familiar with Git as I am with Subversion. I think it will be good to keep doing "practice" sessions to remember how certain commands work (especially vi - I forgot some of the commands that have to do with this text editor). This experience as a whole was very helpful because of the detailed directions provided by the professor. I will keep that resource at hand for future instead of just perusing through the list of commands or Googling every other step of the process.
